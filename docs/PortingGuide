ONL does not have any Networking integrated circuit (IC) code or drivers.
That said, there are still a number of components on a typical switch
that are not supported by a standard Linux kernel.  They include:

1. Power Supply Unit (PSU) management
2. Fan Supply management
3. Pluggable network transcivers, like SFP or SFP+

As a result, ONL depends an abstraction layer called XXX.  XXX 


Need to decide:

1. Which Ethernet MAC:    ma1
2. Which serial port: /dev/ttyS0
3. What are block storage devices are available
4. What is base of firmware eeprom



Assumes:
* uBoot has support for your block device
